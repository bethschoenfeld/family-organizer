This app allows the users to keep their family's activities organized by family members. 

## Technologies Used

## Methods

* Used Express-generator and npm to get the app's boilerplate.
* Built out an ERD and wireframe.
* Built out Schemas and Models.
* Built a Seeds file.
* Set a full CRUD route for each level of my model.
* Worked on README.

## Unsolved Problems

* Cant get my nested edit routes to work. 

* Styling is really tripping me up. Feeling like I haven't had enough time to really work with it.
